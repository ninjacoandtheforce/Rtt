Hi everyone,

The solution is created in Visual Studio 2022 Preview.

I need to make a small change the sqlcommands to convert to an async generic normal sql command repo. You wanted a large volume of transactions, so this is partially similar to a solution written for VW SA, that sits in load balanced Azure environments with a SQL cluster.

I added features to problems that we encountered during development to demonstrate solutions to a similar architecture.  

The error module makes provision for unhandled exceptions, handled exceptions, and server health as we had limited access to the production server.

I would like to showcase a cross platform solution.

Please let me know if you have any problems or feedback.
