Hi everyone,

The solution is created in Visual Studio 2022 Preview.

I added features to problems that we encountered during development to demonstrate solutions to a similar architecture.  

The error module makes provision for unhandled exceptions, handled exceptions, and server health as we had limited access to the production server.

I would like to showcase a cross platform solution.

Please let me know if you have any problems or feedback.
